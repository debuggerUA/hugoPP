## About Me

{{< figure class="avatar" src="/img/avatar.jpeg" alt="avatar">}}

Hi! I'm a professional software developer, mainly for Android.
Based in Ukraine, I'm open for a remote job offers from all around the world.
I'm also interested in part-time and mentoring.

## Overall Experience
More that 10 years of professional software development. Started with Python backends, but wanted to be more in touch with end-users, so switched to Android.
It was a time of [Android Froyo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_Froyo) back then, so you can say I have a history of working with Android.

* Two years in IT tech support for a big website hosting provider
* One year in Python backend development
* **A lot** of time with Android  
  
Most of the time I work with outsorcing company [PI](https://postindustria.com/), which helped me building an experience in different areas: social media, mobile ads, fintech, etc.

## Skills
* Mentoring for software developers
* Mobile app architecture
* HTTP API architecture
* CI/CD pipeline architecture
* Fast feature prototyping
* Implementing features
* Code review

## Mentoring
One of my favorite non-development acivities is being a mentor for local students who want to become an Android developer. When we started this process, I was in charge of:
* initial requirements for students
* training program
* final requirements
* and of course teaching small groups of students, mentoring them even after they finish the course.  

Now it's a successful school, we have prepared a lot of developers, some of them are a junior and mid Android software developers now.
